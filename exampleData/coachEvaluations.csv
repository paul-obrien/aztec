Laneau,Aztecs,2013-09-15,Ryder,2,2,3,2,Player struggling to keep up with teammates.  Slow (and not that fast either).  Really doesn't know what he's doing.  What's he doing on this team?
Laneau,Aztecs,2013-10-01,Ryder,3,3,3,2,Getting a little better.  Still don't know why Kersker stuck me with this uncoordinated goober. Whatever.  I'm getting paid.
Laneau,Aztecs,2013-10-15,Ryder,4,3,4,4,Who is this kid?  Scored 5 goals in the last 3 games.  Unrecognizable from a month ago.  Must be great coaching.
Laneau,Aztecs,2013-11-01,Ryder,2,1,2,2,I think the kid stopped taking the roids.  Can't do anything anymore.  Can't trap.  Can't pass.  Gives the ball away every time.  Ruining my will to live.
Laneau,Aztecs,2013-11-15,Ryder,3,3,3,3,Happy not to have to see this kid again.
Laneau,Aztecs,2013-09-15,Cook,5,5,5,5,Best player on the team by a mile. When are the World Cup tryouts?
Laneau,Aztecs,2013-10-01,Cook,5,5,5,4,Still rolling along. Good for a couple goals a game.  Bit of a prima donna though.
Laneau,Aztecs,2013-10-15,Cook,5,3,4,5,Had an issue a week ago.  He sucker-punched one of his teammates during a game for not giving him the ball.  Still keeps scoring though.
Laneau,Aztecs,2013-11-01,Cook,5,4,4,4,Started playing him in goal. He's just as good there.  This kid can do no wrong.
Laneau,Aztecs,2013-11-15,Cook,5,5,5,5,We won every game this season and it's all due to this kid.  He's better than Messi.  Unreal.
